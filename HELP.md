## \*\*\* See end-notes for additional information

### Auto-hunt
- '**ah** \<**mob**\>' starts autohunt, which will hunt your mob and move you to the next room until you reach your mob.  Navigators can autohunt through portals.  It does not work with mapper cexits - autohunt uses the output of the hunt skill which is limited to cardinal directions only (and portals, for navigators).
- '**aha**' and '**ah0**' will cancel an auto-hunt in progress.
- Autohunt is very useful for navigating mazes, but may put you at risk of aggressive monsters.
- Autohunt requires you to practice up your hunt for it to work.  If your skill is too low, autohunt will not work (it would be pointless as all the directions would be wrong).  Note that this has no effect on the hunt trick (see "ht" hunt trick below).

### Campaign
- '**xcp**' targets the first available mob on your cp list and gets possible locations. "Available" means living and location is known.  E.g. the first four mobs on your list are all dead, unknown, and/or both, "xcp" will ignore all of those and target the 5th mob.
- '**xcp** \<*n*\>' targets the *n*th target on your main target list, dead or alive.  If dead, the MUD only ever gives the area name, even if the cp is room, so dead mobs are always handled as if the cp were area.
- '**xcp 0**' clears the current target and its room search results.
- '**xcp mode** \<**ht**\|**qw**\|**off**\>' determines what xcp does after running to an area — "ht", "qw", nothing (area cp's only).  In most cases, "qw" (quick-where) will find the right mob on the first try, without having to hunt trick — this is much faster.  
- For area cp's, "xcp" first runs to target area.  Upon arrival, it does quick-where (default) to pick out your cp mob.  If the area has duplicate roomnames, your mob could be in any of them, so use 'go', 'nx', and 'nx-' to check through them.
- For room cp's, "xcp" gets the room data from your mapper and 'go' will run to that room.  If the same roomname exists in multiple areas, S&D will generate a list item for each of them, but only one will be correct.  The effect of this ranges from barely noticeable, to flooding the output window with 12 links for one mob (all but one of which are wrong and therefore useless).  This is due to problems with filtering results by area and level range.  It's on the radar and eventually I'll do something about it.
- Unknown mobs can't be targeted because the location isn't in your mapper db.  For area cp's, this means you've never been to the area at all.  For room cp's it means you haven't mapped any rooms with that name in any area — in most of these cases you'll have been to the area before, but haven't explored (i.e. mapped) every room.

### Gquest
- When you join a gquest, you can do 'gq info' when the gq has started.  S&D will read the relevant gq data and update the display with links for the mobs.  From there, it handles just like a cp.
- The commands for campaigns and gquest are the same (xcp, go, etc.).
- 'cp info' will reload your campaign targets, and 'gq info' will reload your gq targets, allowing you to switch between them.  You must use 'info' and not 'check' because S&D doesn't cache the data when switching, and will need to re-process it from scratch.
- S&D is unable to address various competition mechanics, including but not limited to: bad luck, bad repop timing, PvP ganking, other player intereference.

### "goto" command — run to room within area after getting search results
- '**go**' runs to first room on the list returned by hunt trick / quick where.
- '**go** \<*n*\>' runs to the *n*th room on the list.
- '**go 0**' runs to the area start room (see 'xset mark').  This is useful for areas like Nenukon and similar maze, etc. situations where 'mapper goto' is unable to find a path.

### "ht" (hunt trick) command — leverage cp hunt mechanics to find target mob and location
- '**ht**' runs the hunt trick (ingame: **'help hunt trick'**) on your currently-targeted cp mob.
- '**ht** \<**mobname**\>' runs hunt trick on mobname, 2.mobname, 3.mobname, etc. until it finds the target or fails to do so after testing all instances.
- '**ht** \<*n*.**mobname**\>' runs hunt trick starting with *n*.mob Useful for skipping past no-hunt or similar mobs — these will interrupt hunt trick and cause it to time out or simply fail to locate.  "No-hunt" means hunt returns a "No one by that name" message as if the mob doesn't exist in the area.  Normally-huntable mobs return "You seem unable to hunt that target for some reason" when you get it as a cp (or gq) target.
- '**ht abort**', '**hta**', and '**ht0**' all cancel a hunt trick in progress without returning any results.
- Hunt trick does *not* require you to practice (or even have) the hunt skill.  If you don't actually have the skill, hunt will return random directions and also give the "unable to hunt" message for cp/gq mobs.

### "kk" (quick kill) command
- '**kk**' tries to kill the current target
- '**xset kk** \<**command**\>' sets quick-kill to attack with the given skill or spell, e.g. , 'xset kk bs', 'xset kk c 541'

### "nx" and "nx-" commands — run to next or previous room in list of results
- '**nx**' runs to the next room in the list of results, after doing 'go'
- '**nx-**' runs to previous room.
- If you don't use 'go' first, 'nx' and 'nx-' will both run to the first room on the list (same as 'go').  It sometimes messes up and runs you to the second room in the list instead, so 'nx-' to go back.  Technically a bug and is fixable, but not without rewriting a bunch of crap and IMHO not worth it.

### "qw" (quick where) command:
- '**qw**' gets results for your currently-targeted cp mob.
- '**qw** \<**mobname**\>' gets results for given mobname.  Use this when the auto-guesser fails.
- '**qw** \<*n*.**mobname**\>' gets results for *n*.mobname (e.g. 3.fido).
- '**qwx**' gets results for your current 'xcp' target and sets quick-where to look for an exact mobname match.
- When called from 'xcp' or 'qwx', S&D looks for an exact match for your 'xcp' target and will loop through 'where' until it finds it.
- Otherwise, it looks for mob names containing the keywords you give it, and will skip ones that obviously don't match.
- "qw" will fail if the mob is flagged no-where, in a dark room, dead, or otherwise indisposed.  It works intermittently on hidden mobs due to your detect roll vs hidden.

### Automatic noexp toggle:
- '**xset noexp** \<*n*\>' turns automatic noexp on and sets the TNL cutoff to *n*, for n > 0.
- '**xset noexp 0**' turns auto-noexp off.
- '**xset noexp off**' also turns auto-noexp off.
- If you cannot take a new cp at your current level, auto-noexp turns 'noexp' off (enabling exp gain) and allows you to level up.
- If you can take a new cp at your current level, S&D turns 'noexp' off (enabling exp gain) while your TNL is above the cutoff amount that you set.  When your TNL drops below the cutoff, S&D turns 'noexp' on, stopping exp gain until you finish your cp and request a new one.
- Your TNL cutoff should be high enough that over-levelling from massive single-kill xp gain (from stacked doubles, rare kills, etc.) is unlikely—a setting of 1000 to 1200 would be typical.
- When you reach level 200/1, auto-noexp will turn 'noexp' off and leave it off until you remort.
- For most cp's, you'll gain enough xp to level up and be stopped by noexp long before you finish the cp.  Because of this, your levelling speed (time per level) is largely independent of your actual per-level TNL.  This gradually changes as you reach higher tiers and TNL becomes higher (above 6k or 7k).  Until then, you level as fast as you can complete cp's (i.e. kill speed and generally staying on task).

### Vidblain navigation
- '**xset vidblain**' turns on Vidblain navigation, which allows one to quickly and easily cross the dark portal into Vidblain.  It also compensates for the portal's reality-distortion and uncertain transit vector and landing room, enabling straightforward travel to Vidblain destinations which would otherwise be tedious at best.
- '**xset vidblain level** \<*level*\>' turns off Vidblain navigation when you reach the desired level, typically that of your lowest-level Vidblain area portal.  It does take tier into account, as well.  This is useful because it's always faster to use an area portal to get to Vidblain than to run via the dark portal.

### Window commands - change font size, line spacing, etc.
- The window can be dragged to a new location via the title bar, and resized via the widget at bottom right.  Right-clicking the title bar brings up a menu with collapse, expand, and send to front/back.
- '**xset fontsize** \<*n*\>' changes target list font size.  Default is 8.
- '**xset linespace** \<*n*\>' changes target list line spacing.  Default is 14.
- '**xset** \<**off**\|**hide**\|**0**\>' turns the window off and removes it from view.
- '**xset** \<**on**\|**show**\|**1**\>' turns the window on and displays it.

### Xmapper commands
- '**xm** \<**room name**\>' generates 'goto' links for matching rooms in the current area.
- '**xm** \<**room name**\>**|**\<**area id**\>' generates 'goto' links for matching rooms in the given area id, e.g. 'xm along the sea floor|wooble'
- '**xm** \<**room name**\>**|all**' generates 'goto' links for all matching rooms in your database.  Note, there is no limit on how many results it can return, other than the size of your db — it will spam your screen with hundreds or thousands of results if you let it.

### Xtest commands
- '**xtest roomhist**' displays the last 200 rooms you have been in.
- '**xtest simulate cp**' displays a list of various mob names (alive, dead, unknown, etc.)

## End-notes and additional information
- If your character is new (i.e. Tier 0) and single-class, be advised that S&D doesn't do well with level-locks.  This is especially true if your mapper database was built by a character not subject to level locks (i.e. a remort, or tier 1 and above).  The problem is especially bad if your mapper uses any clan or other short-cut exits.  Fixing this on my end is outside the scope of the S&D project, as one of the requirements and expectations is that you manage and optimize your mapper DB to your own individual needs.  Once you remort for the first time, level locks no longer apply and you will no longer experience this issue.

- S&D is a tool.  As such, it can be used competently, or incompetently.  It is to your advantage to do your own mapping—by doing so, you have first-hand experience learning the area layouts and tricks.  Also, only you can know your individual needs; a DB supplied by someone else will almost certainly need a great deal of effort put into it to make it work correctly for you, often to the point that such effort will be comparable to simply mapping the areas for yourself.  Don't do yourself a disservice by cutting corners—I encourage you to do your own exploration and mapping.  It's a lot of fun, and really is the best way to learn and become experienced.

- S&D will not kill mobs for you, and in general a lot of effort and attention has gone into ensuring that the plugin is legal and does not violate Aardwolf's botting rules, or any other rules.  Modifying it to do anything automatically, especially anything that makes it look like a bot is a terrible idea and you ***should not*** do it.  There is very little to be gained by doing so, and the main thing you accomplish is placing your character in mortal jeopardy.  It is also highly disrespectful to the Immortals, and can potentially ruin *their* day too by forcing them to take action against you.  Please don't do that to them; they are good people and they deserve better.  Respect and follow the rules, always.
